NAME

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       read()  attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into
       the buffer starting at buf.

       If count is zero, read() returns zero and has  no  other  results.   If
       count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of
       file), and the file position is advanced by this number.  It is not  an
       error  if  this  number  is smaller than the number of bytes requested;
       this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually  available
       right  now  (maybe  because we were close to end-of-file, or because we

DESCRIPTION

       file referred to by the file descriptor fd.

NAME
       close - close a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS

int close(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
  close()  closes  a  file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to
  any file and may be reused.  Any record locks (see  fcntl(2))  held
  on  the  file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are
  removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to  obtain
  the lock).

  If  fd is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open
  file description (see open(2)), the resources associated  with  the
  open  file  description  are  freed; if the descriptor was the last
  reference to a file which has been removed using unlink(2) the file
  is deleted.

RETURN VALUE
  close()  returns  zero  on  success.  On error, -1 is returned, and
  errno is set appropriately.
